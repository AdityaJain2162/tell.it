        <p class="aboutpara">We've created tell.it with keeping traders out there in mind. This project will significantly help traders by saving their time from checking the price frequently on the web. Firstly, we've brainstormed various ideas that can make change in the financial world and after a lot of analysis we have created this project. In this project when the user runs the script then the script will automatically fetch the current price of British pound in Indian rupees and then it will send the notification by email to the user. We can set the time period after which we want to get notified. We can also set the high price and low price alert so that if the high or low price is triggered then whether the time reached or not it will send the alert price notification via email.
